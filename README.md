# Event Matching and Ranking Solution

## Overview
This solution fetches event data from the Eventbrite API, allows users to input preferences for event selection, and ranks the top 10 events based on relevance to the user-defined criteria. It outputs the results in a structured text file.

---

## Features
- Fetches 10 different event data from the Eventbrite API.
- Allows users to define a custom event strategy via terminal inputs.
- Generates an input JSON file (`input_events.json`) with event data.
- Ranks the top 10 events based on user-defined relevance criteria.
- Outputs the ranked results in `top_10_events.txt`.

---

## API Key Configuration
1. Obtain an API key from [Eventbrite API Platform](https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api/).
2. Normally you would have to replace the placeholder my API in the script with your actual API key, but for the sake of this demonstrate I will provide my own API key.

## Files

### Input Files
- **`input_events.json`**: 
  - Generated by the script with enriched event data fetched from Eventbrite.
  - User inputs (e.g., target audience, objectives, etc.) are entered via the terminal.

### Output Files
- **`top_10_events.txt`**: 
  - A structured output file listing the top 10 events ranked by relevance.
  - Includes event name, URL, description, and relevance rank.

## Ranking Logic

### Input Criteria
The script uses the following user-defined criteria:
 - Target Audience: Description of intended attendees (e.g., job titles, demographics).
 - Objectives: Goals like networking, lead generation, or brand awareness.
 - Industry Sector: Specific industry sectors like technology or healthcare.
 - Geographic Focus: Preferred regions for events (e.g., "NYC, NY").
 - Budget Constraints: User-defined acceptable budget ranges.
 - KPIs: Key performance indicators, e.g., attendee count or leads generated.

### Ranking Scoring 
The script calculates a relevance score for each event based on:
1. Location Match: +50 points for close matches.
2. Objective Match: +25 points for aligning objectives.
3. Industry Match: +25 points for aligning industry sectors.
4. Available Tickets: +10 points if tickets are available.
5. Sold Out: -10 points for events marked as sold out.

## Output Format 
The output is a ranked list of the top 10 events matching the userâ€™s strategy. Each entry includes:
 - Event Name
 - Event URL
 - Brief Description
 - Relevance Rank

---

## Assumptions
 - Events without venue or ticket data are excluded.
 - If the user's geographic focus does not match any event location, no location weight is applied.
 - Events are ranked based solely on available data from the Eventbrite API.

---

## Run the Script
To execute the solution:
 - Clone the repository
 - python main.py
 - Follow the prompts to input your event strategy.
 - The script generates input_events.json and ranks events into top_10_events.txt.

---

## Limitations
 - Relies on the Eventbrite API for accurate data.
 - Location matching is simplified to a text-based comparison rather than real geographic distances.
 - Assumes user inputs are formatted correctly and within valid ranges.
